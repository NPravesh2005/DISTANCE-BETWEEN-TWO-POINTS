# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function, do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Take the two coordinates as l1 and l2
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Using the print function, display the distance between the two points
### Step 5: 
End the program

### PROGRAM:

```python
import math
x1 = 10
x2 = 4
y1 = 6
y2 = 2
inside_the_root_simplification = pow((x2 - x1),2) + pow((y2 - y1),2)
distance = math.sqrt(inside_the_root_simplification)
print("%.2f"%d)
```
